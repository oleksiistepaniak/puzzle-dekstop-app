PuzzleGame is a puzzle game application.
Your task is to assemble puzzles on the graphical interface to recreate
the picture shown when the Solution button is pressed.
The functionality of this game includes:
- The Solution button allows you to view the correct solution.
- The Shuffle button allows you to shuffle the puzzles on the graphical
interface in a random order.
- The Mute music button allows you to turn off the background music.
- The Enable music button allows you to turn on the background music.
- The About game button allows you to read information about the game.
- You can drag and move the puzzle pieces on the graphical interface
using the mouse.
In the future, the game will be further developed and any bugs will be
fixed (such as implementing functionality for automatically checking
the solution placed by the player on the graphical interface,
authentication/registration, high scores, etc.). For any suggestions
or bug reports, please email me at alexstepanyak@gmail.com.
